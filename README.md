(very much still a work-in-progress!)

An adaptation of [Danny Kirchmeier's ping-pong scorekeeper](https://github.com/danthegoodman/pingpong) to React,
mainly for use in my garage. This also serves as my guinea pig for experimenting with the
[Discovery Testing](https://github.com/testdouble/contributing-tests/wiki/Discovery-Testing) approach to TDD.

For now I'm focusing on just the scorekeeping portion; the player stats tracking can come later.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app);
the following instructions come from there:

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run storybook`

Launches [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
